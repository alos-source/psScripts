# Description
Unfortunatellely, the filesnames of documents provided by TradeRepublic are not human readable. So when putting all the documents in a folder, there is no structure. There are two approaches to handle this:
- PDF-Renaming, like in the [Project](https://github.com/FabianSer/TradeRepublic-PDF-Renaming)
- Organizing in Folders

I would prefer the later solution. So this Project tries to read out the type of the document, from the PDFs meta data and put the documents in respective folders:
- Cash Account Statement
- Corporate Action
- Crypto Deposit Statement
- Ex-Post Cost Report
- General Meeting
- Income
- Securities Account Statement
- Securities Settlement
- Sharebooking
